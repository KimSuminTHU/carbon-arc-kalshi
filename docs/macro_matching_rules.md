# Macro Matching Rules (Stage A2)

Stage A2 maps every Kalshi series in `outputs/kalshi_series_all.csv` (10,161 series)
to entries in `outputs/auto/macro_event_master_list.csv`. Match → series is
"macro Kalshi" for this plan; no match → out of scope (handled by later plans).

## Rules

1. **Case-insensitive regex** against the concatenation `title + " " + sub_title + " " + rules_primary (if any)`.
2. **Word boundaries** (`\b...\b`) — no substring matches inside other words.
3. Each event_name has a small alias set listed below. **All aliases are from
   official BLS / BEA / Census / Fed / UMich abbreviations**; none are guessed.
4. A Kalshi series can match **multiple** events (e.g., a "Recession" market may
   match both `gdp` and `recession_prob`).
5. Adding any new alias triggers a *full re-run* of Stage A2 (Phase 0b §3.2).

## Negative controls (verified that rules don't false-positive these)

These Kalshi titles must *not* match any macro event:

- "Will the Beatles have 3.5B streams in 2026?" → no match (music)
- "MrBeast Million Dollar Puzzle completion" → no match
- "Will Elon Musk visit Mars in his lifetime?" → no match
- "Oscar for Best Picture" → no match
- "Boxing match result" → no match

If any of these match, the rules have a bug → fix and re-run.
